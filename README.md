# 🌊 Ness Bin App 🗑️

**nessbinapp.com** — keeping Ness on time for bins so folk can do more important things like go surf 🤙  

A simple, community tool that scrapes the **Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (CNES)** website and shows **live bin collection dates** for Ness villages.  
Locals can check bin days on the site or download `.ics` calendar files to sync with Google/Apple/Outlook.

💚 WE LOVE NESS 💚

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Black / Blue / Green bin scrapers** — live data from CNES tables  
- ✅ **North & South Ness calendar downloads** (`.ics`)  
- ✅ Clean, mobile-friendly UI with big buttons  
- ✅ Self-hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with custom domain: [nessbinapp.com](https://nessbinapp.com)  
- ✅ Shared CSS for consistent look across all pages

## 📅 How it Works

1. Scrapers use **axios** + **cheerio** to fetch the CNES bin collection tables.  
2. Data is parsed into months/dates and shown in clean HTML pages.  
3. `/api/calendar/north` and `/api/calendar/south` use the same scraped data to build `.ics` files with the **ics** library.  
4. The `.ics` can be imported into any calendar app.  
5. Because CNES only publishes **~2–3 months at a time**, the `.ics` always matches what’s live.
